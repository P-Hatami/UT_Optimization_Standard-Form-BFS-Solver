# UT_Optimization_Standard-Form-BFS-Solver
MATLAB solver for Basic Feasible Solutions (BFS) in Linear Programming. This version features dual-layer validation: satisfying global linear inequalities ($AX \le b$) and enforcing non-negativity constraints ($X \ge 0$). Ideal for vertex enumeration and geometric analysis of the Simplex method's feasible search space.
